<p><em>"For example, radiation tolerant versions of 3GPP SoC/SiPs do not exist to date, and would
require deep IC re-design, using both more resilient processes (like SOI) and/or ah-hoc
mitigation techniques (like Error Detection and Correction, memory scrubbing, triple
redundancy)."</em></p>

<p><em>"Additionally, incrementing infrastructure in space
to build large space weather networks will provide alerts to
astronauts exploring the surface of the Moon and Mars.
Similarly, incrementing assets observing deep-space planetary
environments on an “as needed” basis will enable multi-shot
observation of possible life on other planetary bodies like
Enceladus and Europa. This is particularly important in
communication limited environments of planetary exploration.
Lastly, being able to capture celestial events by connecting
large telescopes and observatories through responsive obser-
vation will unlock insights into universe formation questions
and habitable worlds"</em> </p>
